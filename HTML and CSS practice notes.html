		<h1>HTML Notes</h1>
		
		<p>An HTML file always begins with &lt;!DOCTYPE html> so that a browser knows what markup language it is reading.</p>

		<p>Anything between the opening &lt;html>and closing &lt;/html> tags will be interpreted as HTML code.</p>

		<p><> is an opening tag that must always come first and &lt;/> is a closing tag that must alwasy come last.</p>

		<p>Titles will not appear in the document, but will appear in the tab bar.</p>

		<p>Putting anything between &lt;body> and &lt;/body> will insert it into ur document.</p>

		<p>Using alt in a image code will aid the visually impaired in understanding your web page.</p>

		<p>You can also add videos to your webpage by using &lt;video src="myVideo.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls>
		Video not supported &lt;/video>. The code must include width and height to specify how large the video screen will be.<p>

		<p>You should use &lt;p> and &lt;/p> whenever you are writing something in the body.</p>

		<p>&lt;br> brand &lt;br /> will separate two lines of writing that you put between it.</p>

		<p>There is a whole hierarchy to HTML to help organize the code you are writing in it.</p>

		<p>Comments can be written in HTML using the code &lt;!-- to open it and -->.</p>

		<p>Headings are used to emphasize words that are used to divide texts in sections.</p>

		<p>You can emphasize words by using &lt;em> and &lt;/em>.</p>

		<p>You can make words bold by using &lt;strong> and &lt;/strong>.</p>

		<p>Putting two line breaks directly next to each other will separate two sentences.</p>

		<p>You can make easy to read unordered lists using &lt;ul> and &lt;/ul> and then separating the words in the list using &lt;li> and &lt;/li>.</p>

		<p>You can make ordered lists using &lt;ol> and &lt;/ol> which puts numbers next to each word in the list.</p>

		<p>You can add images to your webpage using &lt;img src="image-location.com" />.
		This code goes to get the image from the source (src) that you enter in the quotes.<p>

		<p>You can add links to an external webpage using &lt;a href="LINK"> and then closing it with &lt;/a> but this only adds text links.</p>

		<p>You can add an image link by wrapping the &lt;img> tag with &lt;a>.</p>

		<p>You can add links to external webpages that open a new window using the target attribute.</p>
		
		<p>Most webpages are made in a big folder containing smaller folders with different sections of a website.
		And to open each folder and see what's inside you must use &lt;a href="./Folder Name.html"></p>

		<p>We can make a screen go to a specific portion of the page by using </p>

		<p>Because there is so much content, you cannot see it all on one page So you can make the page go to the top or the bottom by using
		&lt;a href="#top">Top &lt;/a> to go to top and &lt;a href="#bottom">Bottom &lt;/a>.</p>

		<p>The tags that we have used so far are non-semantic meaning they do not describe the content inside of them. 
		Semantic tags modify the content inside of them.</p>

		<p>The nav element contains links to internal pages or content.</p>
		
		<p>Tables can be created in HTML to display data using &lt;table> and &lt;/table>.</p>
		
		<p>To make rows in a table you must use &lt;tr> and &lt/tr>.</p>
		
		<p>You can add data to a table using &lt;td> and &lt;/td>.</p>
		
		<p>Table data does not make sense without adding table headings using &lt;th scope="Column or Row">The name of it &lt;/th>.</p>
		
		<p>Data can span columns using the colspan attribute and uses an integer greater than or equal to 1 to denote columns. colspan="Number".</p>
		
		<p>Data can span rows using rowspan and an integer greater than or equal to 1. rowspan="Number".</p>
		
		<p>Long tables can be sectioned off using &lt;tbody>.</p>
		
		<p>Table heads can be sectined off using &lt;thead>.</p>
		
		<p>The bottom part of a long table can be sectioned off using &lt;tfoot.</p>
		
		<p>CSS can be used to style tables by adding borders, colours and other elements.</p>

			<h2>CSS Notes</h2>
		
		</head>
		
		<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style sheets.</p>
		
		<p>To style an HTML element you must open it with &lt;style "and then add what you want to change and to what and then close it">.</p>
		
		<p>To change colour and font size of text you use &lt;p style="colour: red; font size: 20px;"> Then the text you want to change.</p>
		
		<p>To change font &lt;p style="font-family: Font Name">.</p>
		
		<p>HTML allows you to write CSS code in a dedicated section of the page. 
		It is opened by using &lt;head> &lt;style> "then what you want to change" { what changes you want to make }.</p>
		
		<p>Most developers avoid mixing code by making separate files for HTML only code and CSS only code.</p>
		
		<p>To link the CSS file to the HTML one you use &lt;link href="File Name.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">.</p>
		
		<p>To change all text in a certain place you only need to put the HTML element you want to change {what you want to change about it}.</p>
		
		<p>The class element is used to change certain elements of a page. We can add multiple classes by just adding different elements.</p>
		
		<p>An ID attribute can be added to an element to by using the name of the element then adding a #.</p>
		
		<p>Classes can be added to attributes so you can change everything with the same class easily.</p>
		
		<p>There is a certain order to which elements get styled by what so you must be careful. Ex: class precedes headings.</p>
		
		<p>Chaining selectors is necessary for some HTML elements and is done by creating multiple selectors.</p>
		
		<p>Nested elements are used to style HTML elements inside other HTML elements.</p>
		
		<p>Something even more specific than IDs are !important and they will override anything else.</p>
		
		<p>It is possible to add CSS styles to CSS selectors which prevents repetitive code.</p>
		
		<p>To style an HTML element using CSS, you need to write a CSS declaration inside of the body of a CSS selector.</p>
		
		<p>The font refers to the font-family and that is what you need to use to change the font on a webpage.</p>
		
		<p>You can also change the font's size using font-size.</p>
		
		<p>Font-weight controls if the text is bold or not.</p>
		
		<p>You can align the text to the right, left or center using text-align.</p>
		
		<p>Changing the color can change the color of the foreground or the background (Foreground is text color).</p>
		
		<p>The opacity of text can also be changed by percentage using opacity.</p>
		
		<p>A background image can be put in your webpage using background-image and then putting the url.</p>
		
		<p>The Box Model is how HTML positions things automatically on a webpage. Using HTML and CSS we have unknowingly learnt about aspects of the Box Model.</p>
		
		<p>The 4 things that can be remodeled are the dimensions, the borders, the paddings and the margins of an element's box.</p>
		
		<p>The six properties that are changeable are the height, width, padding, border, margin and overflow.</p>
		
		<p>Click <img href"https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/unit-4/diagram-boxmodel.svg"> to see each property's use.</p>
		
		<p>The height and width can be changed using height: # of px; and width: # of px.</p>
		
		<p>The borders can be affected by width, style and color.</p>
		
		<p>The border radius modifies the corners of the box the element is inby using border-radius.</p>
		
		<p>The padding of the box can be affected using padding-top, left, right, and bottom.</p>
		
		<p>Using the function margin: ?px; will affect all four sides of the box. But, each specific side can be modified using margin-left,
		margin-right, margin-top and margin-bottom.</p>
		
		<p>There is also a margin shortcut that is the same as the padding shortcut, where each margin can be changed in one large function.</p>
		
		<p>Using margin: ?px auto; will set the top and bottom margins to something and then center the element.</p>
		
		<p>Putting a number after an element that you want to change the margin and their sum will be the space in between.</p>
		
		<p>You can set a minimum and a maximum of how large the width of a box will be using min-width and max-width.</p>
		
		<p>The overflow function controls what exceeds the borders of a box. There are three changes which is to hide it, to put a 
		scroll wheel or the default thing is to show it beneath the box.</p>
		
		<p>To change something back to a default stylesheet you have to set everything to 0.</p>
		
		<p>Something can be hidden or made visible by using visibility: hidden/visible;.</p>
		
		<p>There are problems with how we learned the box model because the padding and margin affected the </p>
