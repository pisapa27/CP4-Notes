		<p>console.log("Whatever you want to say") is used to print or log text to the console.</p>
		<p>The four primitive data types are: 
		Strings — Any grouping of keyboard characters (letters, spaces, numbers, or symbols) 
		surrounded by single quotes ('Hello') or double quotes ("World!"). In the example above, 'New York City' is a string.
		Numbers — Any number, including numbers with decimals: 4, 1516, .002, 23.42. In the example above, 40.7 is a number.
		Booleans — Either true or false, with no quotations. In the example above, true is a boolean.
		Null — Can only be null. It represents the absence of value.</p>
		<p>JavaScript uses +, -, / and * to add, subtract, divide and multiply numbers.</p>
		<p>Put .length after what you want to log to count the characters.</p>
		<p>On the first line, the .toUpperCase() method is called on the string instance 'Hello'. 
		The result is logged to the console. This method returns a string in all capital letters: 'HELLO'.
		On the second line, the .startsWith() method is called on the string instance "Hey". 
		This method also accepts the character 'H' as an input between the opening and closing parentheses. 
		Since the string 'Hey' does start with the letter 'H', the method returns the boolean true.</p>
		<p>Math.random generates a random number between 0 and 1.
		We then multiply that number by 50, so now we have a number between 0 and 50.
		Then, Math.floor rounds the number down to the nearest whole number.</p>
		<p>A single line comment will comment out a single line and is denoted with two forward slashes // preceding a line of JavaScript code.
		A multi-line comment will comment out multiple lines and is denoted with /* to begin the comment, and */ to end the comment.</p>
