		<p>An HTML file always begins with &lt;!DOCTYPE html> so that a browser knows what markup language it is reading.</p>

		<p>Anything between the opening &lt;html>and closing &lt;/html> tags will be interpreted as HTML code.</p>

		<p><> is an opening tag that must always come first and &lt;/> is a closing tag that must alwasy come last.</p>

		<p>Titles will not appear in the document, but will appear in the tab bar.</p>

		<p>Putting anything between &lt;body> and &lt;/body> will insert it into ur document.</p>

		<p>Using alt in a image code will aid the visually impaired in understanding your web page.</p>

		<p>You can also add videos to your webpage by using &lt;video src="myVideo.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls>
		Video not supported &lt;/video>. The code must include width and height to specify how large the video screen will be.</p>

		<p>You should use &lt;p> and &lt;/p> whenever you are writing something in the body.</p>

		<p>&lt;br> and &lt;br /> will separate two lines of writing that you put between it.</p>

		<p>There is a whole hierarchy to HTML to help organize the code you are writing in it.</p>

		<p>Comments can be written in HTML using the code &lt;!-- to open it and -->.</p>

		<p>Headings are used to emphasize words that are used to divide texts in sections.</p>

		<p>You can emphasize words by using &lt;em> and &lt;/em>.</p>

		<p>You can make words bold by using &lt;strong> and &lt;/strong>.</p>

		<p>Putting two line breaks directly next to each other will separate two sentences.</p>

		<p>You can make easy to read unordered lists using &lt;ul> and &lt;/ul> and then separating the words in the list using 		&lt;li> and &lt;/li>.</p>

		<p>You can make ordered lists using &lt;ol> and &lt;/ol> which puts numbers next to each word in the list.</p>

		<p>You can add images to your webpage using &lt;img src="image-location.com" />.
		This code goes to get the image from the source (src) that you enter in the quotes.<p>

		<p>You can add links to an external webpage using &lt;a href="LINK"> and then closing it with &lt;/a> but this only adds 		 text links.</p>

		<p>You can add an image link by wrapping the &lt;img> tag with &lt;a>.</p>

		<p>You can add links to external webpages that open a new window using the target attribute.</p>
		
		<p>Most webpages are made in a big folder containing smaller folders with different sections of a website.
		And to open each folder and see what's inside you must use &lt;a href="./Folder Name.html"></p>

		<p>We can make a screen go to a specific portion of the page by using </p>
