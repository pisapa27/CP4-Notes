<p>An HTML file always begins with &lt;!DOCTYPE html> so that a browser knows what markup language it is reading.</p>

<p>Anything between the opening &lt;html>and closing &lt;/html> tags will be interpreted as HTML code.</p>

<p><> is an opening tag that must always come first and &lt;/> is a closing tag that must alwasy come last.</p>

<p>Titles will not appear in the document, but will appear in the tab bar.</p>

<p>Putting anything between &lt;body> and &lt;/body> will insert it into ur document.</p>

<p>Comments can be written in HTML using the code &lt;!-- to open it and -->.</p>

<p>Headings are used to emphasize words that are used to divide texts in sections.</p>
