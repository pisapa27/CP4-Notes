# CP4-Notes
An HTML file always begins with <!DOCTYPE html& so that a browser knows what markup language it is reading. Anything between the opening <html& and closing </html& tags will be interpreted as HTML code. <> is an opening tag that must always come first and </& is a closing tag that must alwasy come last. Titles will not appear in the document, but will appear in the tab bar. Putting anything between <body and </body& will insert it into ur document. You should use <p& and </p& whenever you are writing something in the body. <br& and <br /& will separate two lines of writing that you put between it. There is a whole hierarchy to HTML to help organize the code you are writing in it.
